a) Purpose of the Program(s): The purpose of the grading program is to ask the user to input their overall grade percentage, between 0 and 1, and then print the corresponding letter grade to the terminal.

The purpose of the month program is to ask the user to input the month's name as input, and then print the expected number of days in that month in the year 2023 CE.

b) Input: The grading program's input is the overall grade given by the user. The monthly program's input is the month the user provides.

c) Expected Output: The grading program's output is a letter grade from the given information. The monthly program comes out as the number of days of the given information.

d) Type of Execution: The type(s) of execution for the grading and monthly program is the Conditional execution.

e) Possible Improvements: The grading program could be improved by: My program currently does not accept integers as an input for the letter grades so I could also allow the program to allow both integers and float variable types with a few adjustments in my program. Also with more data inputted, I can have an ordered list of what grade each student got for their scores.

The monthly could be improved by: Having the else error print out (this program only accepts uppercase input). Also If I was more knowledgeable about Python I could find a way to reduce the repetitive coding.
